# Classic Gameboy

A game boy made with react and stitches. You can interact with all buttons but it does nothing yet.
This project is under development.

## Why?
I create this project just to study [stitches](https://stitches.dev/) with react. So it has just bare functionalities and i dont think to improve it. 
But if you want to contribute, feel confortably to send me pull requests.
